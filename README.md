# Numeral system calculator

This program is designed to perform simple math operations on numbers far bigger than simple types provide. It can not only compute numbers of reasonably unbounded length, but also perform calculations across different numeral systems ranging from 2-99 efficiently.

## How to Use

To use the program, follow the pattern presented in the sample in.txt file (which should also be named in.txt) and place it in a directory with the executable. You will have the option to receive results in a single file or multiple files (one operation per file).
Available Operations

## The program supports the following operations:

    Addition (+)
    Division (/)
    Multiplication (*)
    Modulo (%)
    Exponentiation (^)
    Conversion between numeral system (10 2) -> from decimal to binary

## Output

The results of your calculations will be presented in an out(n).txt file(s), where n represents the operation number. For example, if you perform three operations, the results will be presented in out1.txt, out2.txt, and out3.txt.

## Sample Input

Presented in file in.txt
